# Gas Station Management System

## Project Overview
A comprehensive gas station management system built with React/TypeScript frontend and Node.js/Express backend, using PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM. The system handles employee authentication, fuel transactions, payment processing, and audit logging.

## Recent Changes (January 2025)
- ✅ Successfully migrated from Lovable/Supabase to Replit environment
- ✅ Implemented secure client/server separation architecture
- ✅ Replaced Supabase with Neon PostgreSQL database using Drizzle ORM
- ✅ Created comprehensive API routes for authentication and transactions
- ✅ Added proper schema validation and error handling
- ✅ Seeded database with fuel types and test employees
- ✅ **Added Advanced Features**: Dashboard, Analytics, and Reports pages
- ✅ Fixed transaction validation issues with decimal number handling
- ✅ Enhanced navigation with role-based access control

## Current Architecture

### Backend (Server)
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon) with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: PIN-based employee login system
- **API Routes**: RESTful endpoints under `/api/*`
- **Security**: Input validation with Zod schemas

### Frontend (Client)  
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS
- **Forms**: react-hook-form with Zod validation

### Database Schema
- **employees**: PIN-based authentication, roles (admin/manager/cashier)
- **fuel_types**: Available fuel products with pricing

- **audit_logs**: Security and activity logging
- **alerts**: System notifications and warnings

## Test Credentials
- Admin: PIN `1234`
- Manager: PIN `5678` 
- Cashier: PIN `9999`

## User Preferences
- Communication: Professional, concise, technical explanations
- Code Style: TypeScript strict mode, proper error handling
- Architecture: Strong client/server separation, secure API design
- Focus: Security, fraud prevention, audit trails

## Development Status
Current version is fully functional with:
